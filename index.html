    <h2>Fictional Character biography</h2>

    <h3>Season 1</h3>
    <p>
      Steve is initially portrayed as a stereotypical 1980s popular "jock"; he has an antagonistic personality, yet
      attracts the attention and admiration of many students. Steve is shown to be dating Nancy Wheeler, but after he
      harasses Jonathan Byers by breaking his camera, Nancy seems to become close to Jonathan. After Steve sees Jonathan
      and Nancy together, he accosts Jonathan, but is beaten by him in a fight. This causes Steve to see the error of
      his ways and abandon his former friends. Traveling to the Byers' home to apologize to the pair, he becomes
      involved in Nancy and Jonathan's fight against the Demogorgon, which they successfully banish. At the conclusion
      of the season, Nancy buys Jonathan a new camera and Steve continues his relationship with Nancy, while becoming
      more friendly towards Jonathan after their shared experience.

    <h3>Season 2</h3>
    <p>
      Steve's relationship with Nancy is stressed, and he breaks up with her after she will not say she loves him. He
      calls her out after her drunken tirade at a party, during which she called their relationship fake. Steve also
      finds himself at odds with Billy Hargrove, a new student at the school who seeks to become its tough guy. Steve
      becomes involved with Mike Wheeler and his friends after Dustin asks him to help find his "pet" D'Artagnan,
      unaware it is a creature from the Upside Down that his friends call a "Demodog." Executive producer Shawn Levy
      said that Steve's evolving role in the second season was initially unplanned, with the Duffer Brothers deciding in
      the middle of writing the season to pair Steve's character with Dustin Henderson due to both characters being
      "alone" and experiencing heartbreak.
    </p>

    <h3>Season 3</h3>
    <p>
      In the third season, his world expanded further with the introduction of Robin Buckley. What started as a
      workplace rivalry at Scoops Ahoy evolved into one of the series' most celebrated platonic friendships after Robin
      came out to him. Through these relationships, Steve found a new sense of purpose and a "found family" that valued
      him for his courage and loyalty, not his superficial popularity. The chemistry between actors Joe Keery and Maya
      Hawke was critically acclaimed, as was the development of a new comedic side to Steve's character. In particular,
      Steve's positive reaction to Robin's coming out as lesbian has been praised for its thoughtful and understanding
      nature.
    </p>

    <h3>Season 4</h3>
    <p>
      In Season 4, Steve was the first to dive into the "water gate" at Lover's Lake to enter the Upside Down, where he
      was attacked by Demobats. He survived and later returned with Nancy and Robin to attack Vecna in the Creel House.
      By the fourth season, lingering feelings for Nancy resurfaced, creating a complex dynamic as he continued to be a
      steadfast protector of her and the entire group.
